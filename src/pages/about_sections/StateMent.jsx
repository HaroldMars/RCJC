      <p>
        More than 20 solid years have passed since RCJCIM was established,
        yet the church never resorted to financial support from other

        own leaders and
        members being sent by the Lord who are willing to commit and
        sacrifice
        their lives in order to spread out Godâ€™s kingdom.

      <h1 className="pt-5">
        2. <b>Self-Theologizing</b>
      </h1>
      <p>
        The church gets its teachings from God,
        not from man-made doctrines that contradict the Word of God.

      <p>
        The church has endured and sustained all ministerial
        needs through mutual support.
