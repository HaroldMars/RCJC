        RCJCIM is a Bible-centered church. All 66 books of the Old and New
        Testament are inspired by the Holy Spirit and are the sole basis of our
        teachings. The statement of faith was created to communicate our
        doctrinal foundation but the extent of our beliefs is not limited to it.
      </p>
      <p className="pt-5 text-blue-400">
        "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
        correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may
        be thoroughly equipped for every good work." 2 Timothy 3:16-17 NIV

      <h2 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine of the Bible</h2>
      <p className="text-blue-400">
        We believe that the Bible is the ONLY Word of God revealed to mankind.
        It was given by inspiration of God and is without error, certain and the
        final authority for faith and in every aspect of the Christian life.{" "}
      </p>
      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Jesus Christ</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that our Lord Jesus Christ is both God and man. He is the second person of the Trinity. He is the ONLY BEGOTTEN SON of GOD, Savior of the whole world and Mediator between God and man.</p>
      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Deity of Jesus Christ</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is God who became flesh. The Father, the Holy Spirit, the angels, the prophets, the apostles and other characters in the Bible witnessed His divine nature. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Trinity</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">Doctrine about Trinity
We believe that there is ONLY one true God, manifested in three persons, God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. The members of the Trinity have distinct individual attributes but they are co-equal with each other. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Salvation</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that the salvation we have received is pertaining to spiritual salvation and is final. This is acquired through faith in Jesus Christ alone. Yet, we must continue to obey the will of God and hold on to it firmly until the final breath of our life so as to make our calling and election sure, or else we will be in great danger. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Water Baptism </h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that water baptism is one of the Lord's commands. We baptize those who have faith, true repentance and strong conviction of the teachings of Jesus, ready to follow all His commands. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Baptism of the Holy Spirit</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Like the early Christians, we exercise the gifts and the works of the Spirit in all spiritual gatherings as well as in our personal devotions. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and the Rapture</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in the visible second coming of Jesus Christ to this world and the Rapture. No one knows the exact date and time for this event except God. His coming is largely for the purpose of gathering all His redeemed to reward them for what they have done. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Heaven</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in a literal heaven. Heaven is the final habitation of all God's righteous people. It is a place of everlasting bliss where there is no night, death, pain, sorrow, corruption and curse. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Hell/Lake of Fire</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in a literal hell. Hell or the lake of fire is a place of eternal torment which has been prepared for the devil and his angels. All wicked and disobedient people or anyone whose name is not found written in the book of life will also be thrown into the lake of fire which is the second death.</p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Prohibition of Eating Blood</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that all Gentiles who have turned to God are prohibited to eat blood, food sacrificed to idols and meat of strangled animals. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Prohibition of Drinking Alcoholic Drinks and Cigarette Smoking</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that drunkenness is strictly prohibited for the people of God. Drinking any kind of alcoholic drink as well as smoking cigarettes to anyone who belongs to the body of Christ is a sin. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 pt-5">Doctrine about Male and Female Pastor</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that both men and women are allowed to pastor a church if he/she has received the gift of becoming a pastor which is not limited to men alone.</p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Giving of Tithes and Offering</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that the giving of tithes and offering is God's command. Everyone must follow in order to protect ourselves from harm and curses. This is not a plan or a law given by a pastor but it is the plan of God Himself. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Mission</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that all Christians are given a mission or a heavenly program of God for us to evangelize people. The Mission is to “GO AND MAKE DISCIPLES OF ALL NATIONS...” </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Worship on Sundays</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that we must set aside a day to praise and worship Jesus Christ — and that day is Sunday.</p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about the Communion</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that the Lord’s Supper is important and must be put into practice. Both the bread and wine must be partaken as symbols of the flesh and blood of Christ. Before taking the Holy Communion, everyone must understand its meaning, search their hearts and ask forgiveness.</p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Idols</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that making images, worshipping and praying to them are forms of idolatry. These images become idols and replace the real unseen God who created the heavens and the earth and all things therein.</p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Worship</h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe that all believers must worship and give their full respect to  God. He is holy, therefore all worshippers must be holy, pleasing and acceptable. No one is excused or exempted from this command. </p>

      <h1 className="text-blue-700 font-bold pt-5">Doctrine about Child Dedication </h1>
      <p className="text-blue-400">We believe in the dedication of children to God instead of baptizing them. Children are innocent in everything they do. They do not have real faith. They are not able to ask real forgiveness. Above all, we want to follow what was done to Jesus when he was eight days old.</p>
